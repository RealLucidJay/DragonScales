**DragonScales** is not just another cleaner. It is a **Neural Bridge** between your PC and Artificial Intelligence.

It scans your specific Hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM), Startup Apps, and Running Services, then packages that data into a context-aware packet. You simply feed this packet to an AI (like Google AI Studio), and it will write a custom optimization script tailored exactly to **your** computer.
